# New York Times Mongo Scrapper
Mongo Scraper scrapes the New York Times and shows the title and summary. There's an option to save articles and, once saved, add notes. Notes and scraped article data is saved on Mongo via mongoose.

It's a full stack application using node and express for the server, deployment on Heroku, Mongo for the database, and Handlebars for the front-end. It follows a MVC (model view controller) design.

## Instructions

1. Click "Scrape new articles" to scrape the New York Times website.
2. Save the article or read it.
3. Click "Saved Articles" to see the ones you saved.
4. Add notes, delete them from saved, or read them.
